== Welcome to Miyagi

Miyagi is your sensei. Its job is to guide you through a Coding Dojo session. 

== Development environment ONLY

For now, I recommend you run it ONLY on your local environment since it *runs ruby code provided with NO filtering*. 

Again, NO SECURITY filtering is being made. So do NOT deploy it to any machine other than your own development box.
